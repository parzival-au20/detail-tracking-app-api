User Management API
This is a Python (Django) backend project that provides a user management system with endpoints to manage users, albums, photos, posts, comments, and todos. The API supports basic CRUD operations, as well as additional features such as filtering incomplete todos and posts.

Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Docker (for containerization)
Docker Compose (for managing multi-container applications)
PostgreSQL (optional, but recommended)
Steps to Install
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone [REPOSITORY_URL]
cd [PROJECT_NAME]
(Optional) If you do not have Docker installed, download it from here.

Build and start the application using Docker Compose:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
This will build the Docker images and start the application and database containers. It also links the db container (PostgreSQL) to the app container (Django app).

The application will be accessible at http://localhost:8000.

Configuration
The Docker Compose setup defines the following services:

app: This service runs the Django application, listens on port 8000, and automatically runs database migrations and starts the Django development server.
db: This service runs a PostgreSQL database instance with the necessary environment variables (DB_HOST, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASS) for connecting to the database.
You can customize the database configuration in the docker-compose.yml file under the environment section for the app and db services.

Dockerfile
The project uses a custom Dockerfile to set up the application environment. Key points of the Dockerfile:

It uses python:3.9-alpine3.13 as the base image, which is a lightweight image for running Python.
It installs dependencies from requirements.txt and requirements.dev.txt (for development purposes).
It creates a virtual environment (/py) to isolate dependencies.
It installs PostgreSQL client and development libraries needed for the application.
It uses a non-root user django-user to run the application.
Docker Compose Configuration
The project includes a docker-compose.yml file to define the services and dependencies:

yaml
Copy code
version: "3.9"

services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      args:
        - DEV=true
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./app:/app
    command: >
      sh -c "python manage.py wait_for_db &&
              python manage.py migrate &&
              python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000"
    environment:
      - DB_HOST=db
      - DB_NAME=devdb
      - DB_USER=devuser
      - DB_PASS=changeme
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: postgres:13-alpine
    ports:
    - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - dev-db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=devdb
      - POSTGRES_USER=devuser
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=changeme

volumes:
  dev-db-data:
Running the Application
Build and start the containers using Docker Compose:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
Wait for the containers to start. The app container will automatically wait for the database to be ready, run migrations, and then start the Django development server.

The application will be available at http://localhost:8000.
